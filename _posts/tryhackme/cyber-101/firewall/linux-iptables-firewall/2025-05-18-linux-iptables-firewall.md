We have multiple firewall options available here.

### **Netfilter**

Netfilter is the framework inside the Linux OS with core firewall functionalities, including packet filtering, NAT, and connection tracking. This framework serves as the foundation for various firewall utilities available in Linux to control network traffic. Some common firewall utilities that utilize this framework are listed below:

- **iptables:** This is the most widely used utility in many Linux distributions. It uses the Netfilter framework that provides various functionalities to control network traffic.
- **nftables:** It is a successor to the “iptables” utility, with enhanced packet filtering and NAT capabilities. It is also based on the Netfilter framework.
- **firewalld:** This utility also operates on the Netfilter framework and has predefined rule sets. It works differently from the others and comes with different pre-built network zone configurations.

### **ufw**

ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall), as the name says, eliminates the complications of making rules in a complex syntax in “iptables”(or its successor) by giving you an easier interface. It is more beginner-friendly. Basically, whatever rules you need in “iptables”, you can define them with some easy commands via ufw, which would then be configuring your desired rules in “iptables”. Let’s have a look at some basic ufw commands down below.

Check status

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw status
Status: inactive
```

Enable firewall

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw enable
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
```

Below is a rule created to allow all the outgoing connections from a Linux machine. The `default` in the command means that we are defining this policy as a default policy allowing all the outgoing traffic unless we define an outgoing traffic restriction on any specific application in a separate rule. You can also make a rule to allow/deny traffic coming into your machine by replacing `outgoing` with `incoming` in the following command:

Allow all outgoing traffic

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw default allow outgoing
Default outgoing policy changed to 'allow'
(be sure to update your rules accordingly)
```

You can deny incoming traffic at any port in your system. Let's say that we want to block incoming SSH traffic. We can achieve this with the command `ufw deny 22/tcp`. As you can see, we first specified the action, `deny` in this case; furthermore, we specified the port and the transport protocol, which is TCP port 22, or simply `22/tcp`.

Deny incoming SSH traffic

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw deny 22/tcp
Rule added
Rule added (v6)

```

To list down all the active rules in a numbered order, you can use the following command:

List all rules

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw status numbered
     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 22/tcp                     DENY IN     Anywhere
[ 2] 22/tcp (v6)                DENY IN     Anywhere (v6)
```

To delete any rule, execute the following command with the rule number to delete:

Delete a rule

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw delete 2
Deleting:
 deny 22/tcp
Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Rule deleted (v6)
```
